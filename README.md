Before you start:

1. Create a GitHub account. If you haven‚Äôt already, visit GitHub to sign up for a free account.

2. Download the Github Desktop app, or know how to use the command line to put project files onto GitHub.

3. Download the project files. We‚Äôve supplied two files for you to use:

‚Ä¢ mobile-form.png is an example of how the layout should look on a mobile phone that‚Äôs 320 pixels wide.

‚Ä¢ desktop-form.png is an example of how the layout should look on tablet and desktop screens that are at least 768 pixels wide.

4. Look at the study guide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJfoft7Ftpeb21qeYtfTF6yo8HYdbKy/view

Instructions:

1. For this project we will be checking the design in Google Chrome version 48 or higher. Different browsers display forms slightly differently so please make sure it looks correct in Google Chrome before submitting.

2. Build the layout using a mobile first design:

‚Ä¢ Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see Configuring the Viewport to understand why and how to add this tag.

‚Ä¢ Look at the provided mockup (mobile-form.png) and add the same content to your index.html file.

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs okay if your checkboxes and radio buttons don‚Äôt match the look of those in the mockups. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to use the standard default radio buttons and checkboxes.

3. Create the form structure:

‚Ä¢ Only use one &lt;form&gt; tag. The &lt;form&gt; tag should contain all the form elements. Add a fieldset and legend for each of the following sections:

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúContact Information‚Äù section of the page, and

‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúNewsletter‚Äù section of the page

‚Ä¢ Note: You don‚Äôt need to make a functioning form ‚Äî that is, it doesn‚Äôt have to do anything when the form is submitted. To do that, you‚Äôd need to add some server-side programming to actually process the user‚Äôs input.

4. Make sure you include the following form field types:

‚Ä¢ text input

‚Ä¢ email input

‚Ä¢ telephone input

‚Ä¢ select menu

‚Ä¢ checkboxes

‚Ä¢ radio buttons

‚Ä¢ textarea

‚Ä¢ submit button

5. Form fields should include the following attributes:

‚Ä¢ input: should include id, type and name attributes.

‚Ä¢ select and textarea: should include id and name attributes.

‚Ä¢ Checkboxes should have identical name attributes but unique value attributes

‚Ä¢ Radio Buttons should have identical name attributes but unique value attributes

6. Add labels to each form element using the HTML &lt;label&gt; tag. The text inside the labels should match the names of the form fields in the mockups.

‚Ä¢ Make sure you properly pair each &lt;label&gt; element with its corresponding form control via the for attribute. See the link above for an example. And don‚Äôt forget about the textarea element. That needs a functioning label too.

‚Ä¢ NOTE: Remember that to associate a label with a form input element, the label‚Äôs ‚Äúfor‚Äù attribute should match the input‚Äôs unique id.

7. Use the input field‚Äôs placeholder attribute to add the text ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to:

‚Ä¢ the Full Name field

‚Ä¢ the Email address field

8. Once you have everything in place for the mobile layout, use a media query to add a breakpoint to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

‚Ä¢ Match the design as it should look on a tablet or desktop that is 768px wide using the desktop-form.png mockup.

‚Ä¢ Use a mobile-first approach by writing your media queries using the min-width property in your CSS.

9. Once all your breakpoints are in place, double check your layout matches both the mockups.

‚Ä¢ Check that the label text position matches both mockups:

o Mobile: Text should be above the form field.

o Desktop: Text should be to the left side of the form field.

10. Use a Google Font for the text. The design uses the ‚ÄúMerriweather‚Äù font but, you can use any Google Font that you‚Äôd like.

11. Add :focus states to the form for when a user clicks or tabs into a text field.

12. Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.

a. Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.

b. There are a few exceptions that you don‚Äôt need to fix:

i. Don‚Äôt worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.

ii. If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudoclasses these errors should be ignored.

iii. If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‚Äò|‚Äô) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.

13. Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist. The checklist is designed to help you make sure you‚Äôve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!

14. If you‚Äôre having trouble with this project, make sure you take a look at this great study guide:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZJfoft7Ftpeb21qeYtfTF6y-o8HYdbKy/view

NOTE: A good practice is to check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that it looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer. If you want, leave a comment to the project reviewer about which browser(s) the project was checked to ensure they are seeing things as you have designed them.

‚Ä¢ Some browser options:

‚Ä¢ Google Chrome

‚Ä¢ Mozilla Firefox

‚Ä¢ Internet Explorer/Edge

‚Ä¢ Safari

EXTRA CREDIT

1.) Additional placeholder text for other text fields.

2.) Use the required attribute to add HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly.

3.) Add at least the following additional styling enhancements to the form, feel free to add extra styling but leave the basic layout the same as the mockup. Change the background color for at least ONE of the main sections of the site.

4.) Uses CSS transitions for focus states. For example, make a background color fade into view when the user clicks on a text field, and fade out when the user clicks or tabs out of the field.
